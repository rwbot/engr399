# Final Project

##  Setup 
1. Get the ROS node for the sensor operational.
2. Verify it's publishing to the designated topic.

## Customize
1. Create a package for the sensor. (eg. gps_pkg, sick_pkg, imu_pkg).
2. Create a launch responsible for all the necessary nodes such that the only step to launch the sensor nodes is just the single launch file.

## Document
1. Create a git repo for the package.
2. In the README, document the steps necessary to get the node running. Start from which packages need to be installed, what permissions need to be set, what hardware connections need to be made, what errors can be expected and how to troubleshoot them etc. Use the format from the ROS wiki (eg. [http://wiki.ros.org/zed-ros-wrapper](http://wiki.ros.org/zed-ros-wrapper)) as a reference.

### What to Submit:
* Send a url to the repo.
* Upload a .zip of the repo.
